BookLed -- An interactive Paper Book
====================================

## **DESCRIPTION**
BookLed is a hardcover paper book, containing electronic hardware, designed for experimenting with **Python** and for exploring **Generative AI**.

In this github repository, examples of Python and Jupyter notebook codes are collected to explore the interfacing this paper book with a PC and with generative AI.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/robotoons/BookLed/wiki) for extensive documentation.

In appearance, BookLed is a normal book with thick card pages. 
At the top of the book, there is a small USB port and switch.

The technological core of the BookLed  is a **page identification sensor**: using a system of magnets, the book is able to recognize which page the user is reading and detect the turning from one page to the next.

So, connect the USB of the BookLed to your PC and launch the **jupyter notebook** or the **python codes** provided in this repository.   
This codes can identify the book’s page and delivers the multimedia content synchronized with the turning of the pages:  

- soundtrack of the book and dubbing of the story with ‘cartoon’ voices.  
- animated backgrounds that virtually extend the printed page to the Web.  
- interaction with **AI generated Little Owl character**.  

## **SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS**
To experiment with the BookLed you need:
  * A BookLed
  * A USB cable
  * A PC
  * Python 3.11.0 or higher or jupyter notebook installed
  * An openAI API account to experiment with generative AI


## **Quick Start**

### 1. Install USB Silabs Drivers
### 2. Go to github to download jupyter notebooks
### 3. Explore Generative AI with the help of Little Owl!
