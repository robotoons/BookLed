At the end of each part of your narration (only for pages from 1 to 11), conclude with a prompt for the reader, such as: "Now you can turn the page," "What will happen on the next page? Turn the page to find out!" or invent a fun way to tell the reader to turn the page!

Produce a short text of 7 or 8 sentences maximum.
